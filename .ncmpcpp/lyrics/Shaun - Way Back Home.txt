Remember when I told you
"No matter where I go
I'll never leave your side
You will never be alone"
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home

I could never let you go
Couldn't run away if I tried
'Cause even when I'm all alone
You still got a hold on my mind
And I'll always let you know
That I'm always gonna hold on

And I told you right from the start
You just say the word and I'll go
No, it doesn't matter how far
'Cause your love is all that I know
Baby, you just stay where you are
And you know I won't be too long
Hold on
Hold on

Remember when I told you
"No matter where I go
I'll never leave your side
You will never be alone"
Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home

조용히 잠든 방을 열어 기억을 꺼내 들어 (Open the quietly sleeping room, I take out my memories)
Joyonghi jamdeun bangeul yeoreo gieogeul kkeonae deureo
부서진 시간 위에서 선명히 너는 떠올라 (You rise clearly, above the shattered time)

길 잃은 마음속에 널 가둔 채 살아 (I live on, keeping you in my lost heart)
Gil ireun mam soge neol gadun chae sara
그만 그만 (Stop, stop)
Geuman, geuman

멈춘 시간 속 잠든 너를 찾아가 (I go looking for you, in time that's stopped)
Meomchun shigan sok jamdeun neoreul chajaga
아무리 막아도 결국 너의 곁인 걸 (No matter the obstacles, I always wind up at your side)
Amuri magado gyeolguk neoye gyeochin geol
길고 긴 여행을 끝내 이젠 돌아가 (My long, Long journey, ends and now I go back)
Gilgo gin yeohaengeul kkeutnae ijen doraga
너라는 집으로 지금 다시 way back home (I find my way back home, to you again)
Neoraneun jibeuro jigeum dashi way back home

세상을 뒤집어 찾으려 해 (I turn the world over, in search of the story)
Sesangeul dwijibeo chajeuryeo hae
오직 너로 완결된 이야기를 (That only you can complete)
Ojik neoro wangyeoldoen iyagireul

No, I won't ever lose
As long as you're there

빛이 다 꺼진 여기 나를 안아줘 (Hold me here with all the light turned off)
Bich-i da kkeojin yeogi naleul an-ajwo

눈을 감으면 소리 없이 밀려와 (If I close my eyes it rushes in soundlessly)
Nuneul gameumyeon sori eopshi millyeowa
이 마음 그 위로 넌 또 한 겹 쌓여가 (You pile up, full again in my heart)
I maeum geu wiro neon tto han gyeob ssahyeoga

Even when we go through changes
Even when we're old
Remember that I told you
I'll find my way back home
